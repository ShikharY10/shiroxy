<!-- # Go Reverse Proxy with SSL and Dynamic Routing -->

Welcome to the Go Reverse Proxy project! This Go-based reverse proxy is designed to provide seamless and secure web traffic management with the following key features:

## Key Features

- **Automatic SSL Certificates**: Effortlessly handle SSL certificates for a finite number of domain names, ensuring secure connections.
- **Custom Traffic Routing**: Implement custom logic to route traffic for specific domains to designated locations.
- **Dynamic Domain Management**: Utilize REST API endpoints to dynamically add and remove domains, enabling flexible and scalable domain management.
- **System and Process Analytics**: Access detailed system and process analytics through REST APIs, providing valuable insights into the performance and health of the system running the proxy.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the [README](README.md) file. You'll find comprehensive guides on configuring your domains, setting up SSL certificates, and using the REST API endpoints to manage your reverse proxy.
